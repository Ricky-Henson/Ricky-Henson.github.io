                    When it comes to food, Keelung, the northern port city in Taiwan, is highly recommended. Unless you stay for a week, it's impossible to experience everything here, but the best thing to do here is to enjoy the fresh seafood, which is sourced from the
                    local port and ocean. The Wu family have been serving 'crab thick soup' for countless years, a kind of Taiwanese style crab soup. Enjoy grilled squid and crab thick soup. <br> <br> You can visit this market on the
                    way back from Jiu Fen, a popular mountain town near Keelung. You don't have to make a special trip to Keelung to visit this market. Buses run regularly between Keelung and the small town, and the train back to Taipei from here is faster.

                    Shilin is usually the busiest and most famous of all the markets in Taipei, as hordes of locals and tourists alike head there to take part in their favorite Taiwanese treats. Start with stinky tofu and ji pai for starters, and if you're willing to wait,
                    look for places with the longest lines, as the locals usually know what's good. You should also head over to Zhong Cheng Hao for one of Taipei's best oyster omelettes. </p>

                    You will usually see a long line at the entrance, so we recommend joining it as soon as you arrive. Locals really like the crispy black pepper buns stuffed with a juicy pork filling. You will always want more once you order. You might want to show restraint,
                    though, because the market is full of countless delectable goods you will want to try later. Additionally, you'll find a number of shops selling handicrafts, souvenirs, and more.</p>

                    Fengjia is a great place to visit if you're in Taichung. Known to be the largest market on the island, this market winds around the central streets of the city with a wide selection of delectable treats. It's highly recommended to get the big sausage
                    little sausage, the one with the orange sign, as well as the black tea stinky tofu, if your nose can deal with it. <br> <br> Also, make sure you check out Dafeng Stewed Pork (大豐爌肉飯), one of the older restaurants
                    around the night market area that serves some delicious pork dishes.</p>

                    Although Taipei is Taiwan's capital, Tainan is undoubtedly the center for Taiwanese cuisine. Although you'll often hear this market called the Tainan Flower Market, the name is a bit of a misinformer, it's mostly food you'll find here, alongside a range
                    of Taiwanese street games and discount clothes stalls. It's not open everyday, it opens three nights a week, alternating with Tainan's other famous market of Dadong, so be sure to check first before you head there. </p>

                    Those of you planning to visit the beautiful east coast of Taiwan, don't miss this huge market in the coastal city of Hualien. Dongdamen is actually a combination of several night markets that have all been brought together. At the back you'll find Aboriginal
                    Street (原住民一條街), a great place to try some of the snacks and eats from the various ethnic groups found around the island. The gua bao, a kind of Taiwanese hamburger, comes highly recommended here along with the spread of freshly grilled
                    seafood, as you might expect from a city straddling the coast. </p>
