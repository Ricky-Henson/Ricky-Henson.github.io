                    The Xiaolongbao is a type of steamed bun or soup dumpling that originated in China, but the Din Tai Fung restaurant in Taiwan made it famous!
                    <br> <br>The dumplings are sold in almost every night market in Taiwan if you can't be bothered to wait in line for long hours at any of the chain restaurants. Raohe Night Market has a small shop near the ornate gates that sells it
                    freshly cooked, and you'll have the opportunity to watch the men who prepare it.
                    <br> <br> If this is your first time eating this, note that it has hot soup 'inside,' so don't stuff it all into your mouth. You should take a small bite on the side to slowly drain the soup out before swallowing it all. Be sure to
                    dip it in vinegar and fresh ginger that they usually provide.

                    The lu wei concept is a street food concept where you choose various ingredients (meat, vegetables, tofu, noodles) from a stall, and then the store chops them all up and cooks them in a delicious brine or broth.
                    <br><br> In Raohe, you can usually spot these stalls easily since they're usually the only ones with tables in the middle of the night market (or you'll see customers picking ingredients from bowls). </p>

                    Pig's blood cake is a blood pudding served on a stick as street food in Taiwan. Its alternative name is black cake. It is made with steamed pork blood, sticky rice and then coated in peanut powder and coriander with dipping sauces. Pig's blood cake came
                    from Fujian to Taiwan and then developed. It is eaten as a snack. It can also be cooked in a hot pot. It is served hot by street vendors who keep it warmed in a wooden box or metal steamer. A description from Seriouseats described
                    it as cross between a rice cake and mochi.

                    often gets confused with the Japanese dish of tempura due to its name, it doesn't really share any similarities. Tianbula is a kind of local fish cake, which vendors will batter and deep fry and then mix with chili powder, depending
                    on how spicy you want it. </p>

                    The meatballs also called Bahwan is a characteristic street food in Taiwan. According to legend, Beidou Town, Changhua County is the original location where the meatballs come from at the end of the 19th century. Its name comes from its appearance, which
                    is generally a translucent oblate shape with a diameter of about 6 to 8 cm. This meatballs is a ball of translucent dough stuffed with pork, bamboo, and shiitake mushrooms, then served in a bowl doused with savory sauce.

                    If you are celebrating Moon Festival with Taiwanese people, the chances are you will be eating plenty of Taiwanese Barbeque with them. However, if you visit the night markets, then you can sample these delicacies all year round. It is fairly simple to
                    make. A BBQ stall will consist of a selection of meat, fish, vegetables, tofu, and other products. The key to good Taiwanese BBQ is the sauce. This will be different at every stall, but will usually consist of soy sauce, oyster sauce,
                    sugar, and a unique combination of herbs and spices.</p>

                    Stinky tofu is a kind of fermented tofu, which has a highly unpleasant, pungent smell, especially when it is deep fried. In Chinese it’s called “chou dou fu“, 臭豆腐. This dish is mostly eaten as a quick snack. It’s a popular street food, typically cooked
                    on the side of the road at small stalls, and it’s not commonly sold in restaurants. Stinky tofu is considered by many to be the national snack of Taiwan.
                    <br><br>Stinky tofu in Raohe is often sold cold, steamed, stewed, or deep-fried. As it is stinky, be prepared that your breath!</p>

                    Taiwanese beef noodle is a beef noodle soup dish originated in Taiwan. It is sometimes referred to as "Sichuan beef noodle soup" (Chinese: Sichuan beef noodle) in Taiwan. Although this usage can create confusion as Sichuan has its own versions of beef
                    noodle soups which may be sold at Sichuanese restaurants under the same name. The beef is often stewed with the broth and simmered, sometimes for hours. In Taiwan, beef noodle vendors may also have optional, often cold side dishes,
                    such as braised dried tofu, seaweed or pork intestine. Beef noodles are often served with suan cai on top, green onion and sometimes other vegetables in the soup as well.</p>

                    In this steamed bread sandwich, braised pork belly and pickled cabbage are often used. Coriander and nuts are also commonly included. That's a lot better than a fast food burger. It's really filling and extremely tasty.

                    Lu Rou Fan is a Taiwanese pork rice bowl that you’re going to love. It’s easy to make but pays off big in terms of flavor, all in one bowl. It calls for pork belly diced into small pieces and browned. This gets braised in a broth made with soy sauce,
                    along with crispy fried shallots and mushrooms, until the fat melts away, leaving the meat so tender that it melts in your mouth. <br> <br> As the origin of the flavor, the sauce is the key to making minced pork
                    rice. The most popular way of preparation seen in Taiwan is stir-frying the ground meat with sliced ​​shallot in oil, and then boiling it in soy sauce.

                    The Taiwanese O-A-Mee Sua came up with the idea of adding oysters and braised pig intestines to this simple dish which made it wildly popular. Mee-sua is made of wheat flour. During the cooking process, starch is released into the soup which acts as a
                    thickening agent. One of the version is made with bonito flakes, dried cuttle fish and chicken stock. Best way to enjoy this dish is to send it slurping into your mouth! For those who love vinegar, this goes really well with black
                    vinegar!

                    This is steamed rice with egg yolk, pork and shitake mushroom that is molded in a cup and usually served with sweet red sauce. Also called tube rice pudding ( not at all like pudding, and not to be confused with Whay Guay), which is also sometimes called
                    rice pudding). <br> <br> To make Tongzai Migao, first stir-fry glutinous rice with mushrooms, shallots, soy sauce, salt, wine, oil, etc., and then put sliced ​​marinated eggs, sliced ​​meat or dried meat into a
                    small cone, and then stir-fry, put glutinous rice, then steamed. After it is cooked, put it upside down on the plate, drizzle with sweet sauce or dried meat, add coriander and dried radish, and it becomes a tube-shaped rice cake. In
                    the early agricultural era, bamboo tube was used as a container, but later it was mainly made of small iron tubes. Although both rice cakes and bamboo rice cakes are served in small bamboo tubes, the taste is very different.
